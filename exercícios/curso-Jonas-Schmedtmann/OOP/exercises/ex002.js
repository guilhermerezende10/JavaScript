// Coding Challenge #2
// Your tasks:
// 1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
// 2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
// by 1.6)
// 3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
// converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
// 4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
// methods, and with the getter and setter.
// Test data:
// ยง Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h


class CarCl {
    constructor(speed, make) {
        this.speed = speed
        this.make = make
    }

    get speedUS() {
        return this.speed / 1.6
    }

    set speedUS(speed) {
        this.speed = speed * 1.6
        
    }

    accelerate() {
        this.speed += 10
        console.log(`'${this.make}' is going at ${this.speed} km/h`)
    }
    
    brake() {
        this.speed -= 5
        console.log(`'${this.make}' is going at ${this.speed} km/h`)
    }

}

const ford = new CarCl(120, 'Ford')
ford.accelerate()
ford.brake()
ford.speedUS = 100
ford.accelerate()
