// Let's continue with our football betting app! This time, we have a map called
// 'gameEvents' (see below) with a log of the events that happened during the
// game. The values are the events themselves, and the keys are the minutes in which
// each event happened (a football game has 90 minutes plus some extra time).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happened (no
// duplicates)
// 2. After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from minute 64
// was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.
// 3. Compute and log the following string to the console: "An event happened, on
// average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)
// 4. Loop over 'gameEvents' and log each element to the console, marking
// whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:
// [FIRST HALF] 17:

const gameEvents = new Map([
    [17, '⚽ GOAL'],
    [36, '� Substitution'],
    [47, '⚽ GOAL'],

    [69, '� Red card'],
    [70, '� Substitution'],
    [72, '� Substitution'],
    [76, '⚽ GOAL'],
    [80, '⚽ GOAL'],
    [92, '� Yellow card'],
    ]);

const events = [...new Set(gameEvents.values())]
console.log(events)

gameEvents.delete(64)
console.log(gameEvents)

console.log(`An event happend, on average, every ${90 / gameEvents.size} minutes`)

for(const [key, value] of gameEvents) {
    console.log(`${key <= 45 ? '[FIRST HALF]': '[SECOND HALF]'} ${key}: ${value}`)
